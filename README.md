# Milestone-One-Browser-Game
This is an online browser game for my Milestone project, written in html, CSS, and JavaScript.

Title: Bid to Win

My game will be a price guessing game, inspired by the price is right.  You will have to guess the price of random items that exist in today's markets.

100 points will be awarded for every correct answer.

To win, you have to score 700 points on or before the final question. And you lose the game if you complete the game without achieving a score of 700 points.
