# Milestone-One-Browser-Game
This is a browser game for my Milestone project, written in html, CSS, and JavaScript.

Title: Bid to Win 

My game will be a price guessing game, inspired by the price is right.Â 
You will have to guess the price of random items that exist in today's markets.

100 points will be awarded for every correct answer and -25 points for every wrong answer.

You win if you reach 1,000 points on or before the 20th game question.

I will be using HTML and CSS to design a beautiful UI and JavaScript to iterate through questions and answers as the player attempts to answer questions correctly to win the game.
